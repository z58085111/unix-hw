I run a script to observe difference of speed between the two versions. The following is result:

original version run 5000 times:

real	0m34.895s
user	0m4.704s
sys	0m16.056s

chdir version run 5000 times:

real	0m25.228s
user	0m4.160s
sys	0m16.424s

The experiment calculates average time of the two version by running 5000 times on home directory. respectively. Using chdir in ftw8 is faster than original ftw8.
